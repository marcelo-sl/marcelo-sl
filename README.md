## Hi there, my name is Marcelo and I'm a software developer, let me tell you more about me.

As a software developer, I have experience in .NET C# since 2020. During this time, I have developed applications across multiple platforms, including web, desktop, and services. I used C# to create efficient and scalable solutions, integrating systems and APIs using .NET technologies.

Managed databases with SQL Server and Entity Framework/Dapper to ensure data integrity and performance. I implemented security measures in my applications, such as authentication, authorization and encryption, to protect sensitive information.

I performed testing and debugging to ensure the quality and correct functioning of the software, and collaborated in teams using Git for version control and efficient collaboration. I kept up to date with best practices and trends in the .NET ecosystem to apply them to my projects.
